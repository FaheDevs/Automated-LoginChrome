# Automated-LoginChrome
usin Selenium to automate the login process on a website using Chrome




This script uses the Chrome webdriver, you may have to install the chrome driver in your system and provide the path of it in the script. You should also keep in mind that this script is just an example and the website you want to connect to might have different form fields and structure so you should check the website's structure and adjust the script accordingly.

I want to remind you that this script is interacting with a website in an automated way, this could be against the website's terms of service, and it could also raise some security issues. So please be sure of what you are doing, and take the necessary precautions to prevent any security breaches.
